# üìÅ Level 1 - Task 1: Top 3 Most Common Cuisines
## Description
This project focuses on identifying the top 3 most frequently occurring cuisines across all restaurants in the dataset. The goal is to understand customer preferences and the dominant food trends in the region.

### What Was Done:
- Cleaned the `Cuisines` column by handling missing values and separating multiple cuisines listed in a single cell.
- Used Python (`pandas`) to split and "explode" the cuisine entries so that each cuisine is individually counted.
- Calculated the frequency and percentage of each cuisine to identify the top 3.

### Insights:
- The result revealed the most popular cuisines in the dataset.
- Percentage calculations gave a proportional view of how dominant these top cuisines are among all available options.
